title: First thoughts

So I finally got to do this! I was thinking about getting myself a blog for a long time, but like the guys from [NOFX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOFX) I too am a [Professional Crastinator](http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nofx/professionalcrastination.html). Now the plan is simple, every time that I put my hands on code or feel inspired about some new idea I am going to share it here. It's a win-win. 

I started my mission looking for blogging engines, all I wanted was something simple and to blog with markdown. I never thought that were [so many choices](https://www.google.com/search?q=blog+with+markdown), and with great choices came also great complications, right uncle ben? 

So I remembered some websites I have seen with this "github.io" kind of url. Weird... but well, why not?
Turns out this [github-pages](https://pages.github.com/) thing is just amazing, and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) also is amazing, now everything is beautiful and life is good. All I ever wanted: blog in markdown with my good old friend [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) and post with a `git push`.

In the next few days I may start a series of posts sharing some thoughts about testing. From A to TDD.

Keep tuned!
